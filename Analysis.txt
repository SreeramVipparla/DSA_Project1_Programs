Task0:
Method:
Since the index of a list start from 0, thats the index from where we get the first value.
Python has a way to get the last element in a list by putting '-1' as index number.
Run time: O(1)

Task1:
Method:
We get all the values in a set. A set is like a list but only keeping unqie values.
Run time: O(n) since we go through the list once

Task2:
Method:
Here we use a dictionary to store the telephone numbers and the total time spent on each (both, receiving and calling numbers)
Once the dictionary is made, we loop through it and find the maximum time and the phone number corresponding to it.
Run time: O(n) since we go through the list once. Worst case for looping through the dictionary is going to be O(n) again.

Task3: 
Method:
Since we need unique area codes, we store the values of area codes called by fixed numbers in banglore in a set.
Also we need to keep a count of calls made from a banglore fixed line to other fixed lines and banglore fixed line to banglore fixed line.
Run time: O(nlogn) since we sort the set once and worst case scenario is original list has all unique values.

Task4:
Method:
We add all phone numbers that make calls into a set and remove the phone numbers which receive phone calls and send or receive texts
There is a sort function involved and python sort does it in O(nlogn)
Run time: O(nlogn) since we have to sort the set and worst case scenario is that there are all unique values in the original list.
