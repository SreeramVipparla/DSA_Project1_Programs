Task0:
The total time complexity of the code is O(1)


Task1:
The total time complexity of the code is O(n)

Task2:
The total time complexity of the code is O(n)

Task3: 
Part A:

The total time complexity of the code is  O(nlog(n))

PartB:
The total time complexity of the code is  O(n)

Task4:
The total time complexity of the code is O(nlogn) since we have to sort the set and worst case scenario is that there are all unique values in the original list.
